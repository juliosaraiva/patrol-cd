# Component: `internal/cli/admin` (`patrol admin`)

Status: implemented; every command is exercised by tests (envtest kube-apiserver 1.36 for the
commands that talk to Kubernetes). Not yet wired into `cmd/patrol` (owned by the CLI core
workstream, see [Integration](#integration)).
Decision records: [ADR-0002](../adr/0002-api-group-and-versioning.md) (API group and its
migration), [ADR-0003](../adr/0003-resource-model.md) (Repository/Cluster CRDs, credentials
Secrets), [ADR-0004](../adr/0004-no-redis.md) (no Redis), [ADR-0006](../adr/0006-internal-apis.md)
(repo-server token), [ADR-0012](../adr/0012-notifications.md).
Parity status: [`docs/parity/status/cli-admin.yaml`](../../parity/status/cli-admin.yaml).

`patrol admin` is the counterpart of `argocd admin` (Argo CD v3.5.5): administrative commands
that use the kubeconfig credentials directly instead of the Patrol CD API server. They read and
write the Patrol CD objects (group `cd.patrol.example`), the settings ConfigMaps/Secrets
(`patrol-cm`, `patrol-rbac-cm`, `patrol-cmd-params-cm`, …) and, for the repo-server backed
commands, call the repo-server with the internal token.

## Integration

```go
f := &admin.Factory{IOStreams: admin.IOStreams{In: os.Stdin, Out: os.Stdout, ErrOut: os.Stderr}, PromptsEnabled: true}
admin.Register(root, f)              // adds "admin" once
err := root.ExecuteContext(ctx)
os.Exit(admin.ExitCode(err))         // 0, 1, or the command's code (argocd-import: 2)
```

`Factory` (in `factory.go`) is deliberately narrow: streams, an optional `*slog.Logger`
(default: text at warn level to `ErrOut`), an optional `RESTConfig` override (tests, embedding),
`PromptsEnabled` and a clock. kubectl connection flags (`--kubeconfig`, `--context`, `-n`, `--server`,
`--token`, `--insecure-skip-tls-verify`, …) are persistent flags of `admin` and shadow root flags of the
same names. Errors that carry an exit code are `*admin.ExitError`.

## Commands

| Command | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `export` | Settings ConfigMaps, referenced and Patrol-labelled Secrets, AppProjects, SCMProviders, Repositories, RepositoryCredentials, Clusters, ApplicationSets, Applications (control-plane namespace plus `--application-namespaces`/`--applicationset-namespaces` or the cmd-params globs; `--namespace-scoped`). Strips uid, resourceVersion, managedFields, status, last-applied; owner references kept with UID cleared. `--include-secrets` (default true) prints a warning that base64 is not encryption; `-o FILE` is written with mode 0600. `--include-operations` adds Operations (with status, as an audit record). |
| `import SOURCE` | Creates/updates in dependency order; owner references re-pointed to the new UIDs (dangling ones dropped with a warning). Never deletes without `--prune`. Prune safety: settings ConfigMaps, `patrol-secret` and `patrol-notifications-secret` are never pruned; Secrets are pruned only when the backup contains Secrets (a `--include-secrets=false` backup prunes none) and only when managed by Patrol CD (`cd.patrol.example/secret-type` label or `managed-by: patrol-cd` annotation; Secrets that are only referenced are restored but never pruned); Applications' finalizers are removed before a prune delete; objects owned by a pruned ApplicationSet, Repository, RepositoryCredential, Cluster or SCMProvider are released (owner reference removed) before the owner is deleted with a UID precondition, so neither the garbage collector nor the ApplicationSet controller's ordered deletion removes them. `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--override-on-conflict`, `--skip-resources-with-label`, `--stop-operation` (sets `spec.cancel` on running Operations), `--ignore-tracking`, `--prompts-enabled`. Objects of another API group are refused (Argo CD's points to `argocd-import`, other Patrol groups require `--migrate-group`). Operations are never re-created. |
| `settings validate` | Upstream groups and output (`✅`/`❌`). Flags renamed `--patrol-cm-path`/`--patrol-secret-path` (hidden `--argocd-*` aliases), `--load-cluster-settings`; Patrol addition `--settings-file` (repeatable) for the other settings objects. A file Secret without `server.secretkey` is validated as if present (patrol-server generates it). |
| `settings resource-overrides` | `ignore-differences`, `ignore-resource-updates`, `health`, `list-actions`, `run-action` (alias `action`), using the real diff normalizers and the Lua runtime; upstream messages. |
| `settings rbac can / validate` | Upstream wording and exit codes (`Yes`/`No`, `-q`), policies from `--policy-file` (CSV or ConfigMap YAML) or `--namespace`. |
| `notifications template get/notify`, `trigger get/run` | Cluster configuration or `--config-map`/`--secret` files (`-` = stdin, `:empty`); repo-server flags for `repo.*` helpers. RESOURCE_NAME is a file when it exists, else an Application. `template notify` delivers to `console` recipients and, **by default, only renders other services** (`--dry-run=false` sends, as upstream always does). |
| `cluster stats / shards` | Same flags and sharding algorithms (`internal/controller/sharding`); statistics come from `Cluster.status` written by the controller (no Redis). Redis flags are accepted and reported as ignored. |
| `cluster namespaces`, `enable-namespaced-mode`, `disable-namespaced-mode` | `--dry-run` default true, `--max-namespace-count`, `--cluster-resources`. |
| `cluster kubeconfig CLUSTER_URL [OUTPUT_PATH]` | Kubeconfig equivalent to the controller's REST config. Written with mode 0600 to OUTPUT_PATH/`--output-file`; printed to stdout only with credentials redacted (upstream requires the path). |
| `cluster generate-spec CONTEXT` | Cluster object plus credentials Secret (ADR-0003). `--generate-bearer-token` creates `<sa>-long-lived-token` and waits for the token. Credentials are redacted on stdout; `--output-file` (0600) has them. |
| `app generate-spec`, `get-reconcile-results`, `diff-reconcile-results` | Same flags as `app create`. `--refresh` builds settings, cluster registry, repository resolver, live-state cache and the comparison engine in-process and calls the repo-server (`--repo-server`, `--repo-server-token-file`, TLS by default, `--repo-server-plaintext` explicit). |
| `repo generate-spec REPOURL` | Repository object (named like the API's, `repo-<hash>`) plus `<name>-creds` Secret; validations of `repo add`; password prompt. Redacted on stdout except username and client certificate; `--output-file` (0600). |
| `proj generate-spec`, `update-role-policy`, `generate-allow-list` | `update-role-policy` defaults to dry run and prints a unified diff; unchanged policies are not rewritten. `generate-allow-list` resolves resources through discovery (upstream rules: first apiGroup, create verb). |
| `initial-password` | Upstream output from `patrol-initial-admin-secret`. |
| `redis-initial-password` | No Redis (ADR-0004): prints a not-applicable message, exit 0. |
| `dashboard` | See below. |
| `migrate-group` | Patrol addition (ADR-0002): copies the configuration objects from `--from-group` to `--to-group`, rewriting keys, finalizers, owner references and adopting credentials Secrets; dry run by default; sources are never modified. |
| `argocd-import SOURCE` | Patrol addition: see below. |

### `dashboard`

Upstream starts an in-process API server and UI with authentication disabled. Patrol CD
instead serves a loopback reverse proxy (`--address localhost`, `--port 8080`) to a running
`patrol-server` pod reached through the Kubernetes API (`pods/portforward`); users log in as on
the server. The upstream TLS connection is verified: the certificate in `patrol-secret`
(`tls.crt`) is pinned when present, otherwise `--server-crt` or the system roots are used;
`--insecure` and `--plaintext` are explicit opt-outs. A non-loopback `--address` prints a
warning. The browser's Host header is kept (server-side origin checks); Server-Sent Events are
streamed.

Port forwarding speaks the kubelet WebSocket channel protocol (`v4.channel.k8s.io`) with
`github.com/coder/websocket`: client-go's `tools/portforward` needs `github.com/gorilla/websocket`
and `k8s.io/streaming`, which are not in `go.mod`/`go.sum` (this workstream may not change them).
Messages are at most 32 KiB including the channel byte; received messages are bounded to 1 MiB.

### `argocd-import`

Reads an Argo CD export (`argocd admin export` output or any stream of Argo CD Applications,
AppProjects, ApplicationSets, repository/credential-template/cluster Secrets and `argocd-*`
settings) and converts it:

- settings: `argocd-*` → `patrol-*`; `resource.customizations.*.argoproj.io_{Application,ApplicationSet,AppProject}` keys and the legacy `resource.customizations` YAML move to `cd.patrol.example`; service addresses in cmd-params renamed; the result is validated by `internal/settings` and its findings reported;
- `argocd-secret`: `server.secretkey` and `accounts.*.tokens` are not copied (sessions and API tokens signed by Argo CD are not valid); the admin bcrypt hash is kept;
- repository, repo-creds (and `-write` variants) and cluster Secrets become Repository, RepositoryCredential and Cluster objects with a `<name>-creds` Secret (owner reference added when created); cluster `config` JSON is decoded strictly;
- Argo CD keys (`argocd.argoproj.io/…`, `notifications.argoproj.io/…`, recipients annotations) are mapped; transient keys (refresh, hydrate, tracking-id, notified state) are dropped; ApplicationSet generator selector keys are mapped;
- Applications and ApplicationSet templates: automated sync is disabled (`automated.enabled: false`, settings kept) unless `--keep-auto-sync`; Argo CD finalizers are removed (the Patrol equivalent is named); in-flight `operation` is dropped; project JWT tokens are dropped. ApplicationSet templates are `spec.template` and every generator-level `template` (list, clusters, git, scmProvider, clusterDecisionResource, pullRequest, plugin, matrix, merge, nested children at any depth): generator fields win when merged (`internal/appset/template.MergeTemplate`), so each is converted and reported with its path (`generators[0].matrix.generators[1]….template`);
- `spec.sourceHydrator` (Applications and templates) is a `WARNING`: with `hydrator.enabled`, Patrol CD hydrates an Application without hydration status as soon as it exists (hydrator component, decision "no currentOperation → hydrate"), committing and pushing to the sync (or `hydrateTo`) branch with write credentials whatever the sync policy; the finding names repository and branch and tells to stop Argo CD's hydrator first. `hydrator.enabled: true` in `argocd-cmd-params-cm` is reported too. It is a warning, not blocking: the import itself writes no git data and the hydrator only runs when enabled in Patrol CD;
- the report lists every produced object and findings: `WARNING` (finalizers, resource-tracking transfer procedure, credentials, prune/selfHeal, source hydrator git writes, notification subscriptions and delivery state, namespaces not enabled, settings issues) and `BLOCKING` (unknown fields under strict decoding, unsupported kinds or repository types, invalid Secrets, invalid projects). Blocking findings exit with code 2 and nothing is written.

Default is a dry run. `-o FILE` (0600; Secrets unless `--include-secrets=false`) writes the
converted objects; `--dry-run=false` creates them in the namespace (existing objects are left
unchanged; settings are merged with `--overwrite-settings`). Secret values are never printed.
Ownership of live resources is never taken automatically: the report prints the transfer
procedure for the tracking method in use.

## Security properties

- Secret values are printed only where emitting them is the command's purpose
  (`initial-password`); generate-spec/kubeconfig output redacts credentials unless written to a
  file. No secret is logged (client-go warnings are routed to stderr, deduplicated).
- Every file that may hold credentials (export, generate-spec, kubeconfig, argocd-import
  output) is created or truncated with mode 0600 (an existing file is chmod-ed).
- TLS verification is on by default for the repo-server and patrol-server connections.
- Inputs are bounded: backups 256 MiB, other files 16 MiB, WebSocket messages 1 MiB; URL inputs
  have a 30 s timeout.
- Import and argocd-import refuse foreign API groups and never delete without `--prune`.

## Differences from upstream

- No Redis: `redis-initial-password` is a no-op; Redis flags of `cluster stats/shards` and
  `dashboard` are accepted and ignored with a warning.
- `dashboard` proxies to a real `patrol-server` (login required) instead of starting an
  unauthenticated in-process server.
- `template notify` does not contact services other than `console` unless `--dry-run=false`.
- `cluster kubeconfig` accepts one argument (redacted stdout) besides the upstream two.
- generate-spec commands emit Patrol CD objects (Repository/Cluster + credentials Secret)
  instead of Argo CD Secrets; JSON output of several objects is a `v1` List and YAML a
  multi-document stream.
- `export` writes SCMProviders, Repositories, RepositoryCredentials and Clusters and can include
  Operations; import never recreates Operations.
- `export --include-secrets` (default true, upstream always exports Secrets) and the "referenced
  Secret" rule (Secrets named by Patrol object specs or `$secret:key` settings values that start
  a value or YAML scalar) are Patrol additions; `import --prune` keeps upstream's Secret prune
  rule (fixed name, secret-type label, managed-by annotation) and, unlike upstream, never prunes
  Secrets of a Secret-less backup, `patrol-secret` or `patrol-notifications-secret`, and never
  lets a pruned owner cascade to objects it owns (upstream deletes an ApplicationSet with
  background propagation).
- Settings flags are named after Patrol objects (`--patrol-cm-path`, hidden `--argocd-cm-path`).
- `--logformat`/`--loglevel` on `admin` are accepted (they only apply to `admin` itself, as
  upstream).

## Not implemented / not verified

- The port-forward tunnel has only been exercised against a protocol-faithful fake server
  (no kubelet in envtest; `admin dashboard` was not run against the kind clusters of
  2026-10-19); the dashboard proxy, TLS pinning and pod lookup are tested.
- `cluster stats/shards` read statistics the controller writes to `Cluster.status`; the tests
  seed that status.
- `initial-password` reads the Secret; creating it at first start belongs to patrol-server
  (OPS-031).
